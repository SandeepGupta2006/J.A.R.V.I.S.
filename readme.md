## 📚 For Developers

### Adding Custom Plugins

1. Create a new file in `plugins/` folder (e.g., `my_plugin.py`)
2. Use this template:

```python
# plugins/my_plugin.py

from voice.tts import speak

def register():
    return {
        "trigger": "mytrigger",  # Word that activates plugin
        "description": "My custom plugin",
        "run": run_my_plugin
    }

def run_my_plugin(command, output_widget):
    # Your plugin logic here
    response = "Plugin executed!"
    output_widget.insert("end", response + "\n")
    output_widget.see("end")
    speak(response)
```

3. Restart Jarvis - plugin will auto-load!

### Extending Commands

Edit `core/commands.py` to add new built-in commands. Follow the existing pattern:

```python
elif "my command" in command:
    reply = "Command response"
    # Your logic here
```

### Modifying GUI

- Main GUI: `GUI/gui_main.py`
- Themes: `GUI/themes/themes.py`
- Avatar: `GUI/avatar.py`

## 🔒 API Keys & Security

### Required Keys
- **GEMINI_API_KEY** – Required for AI conversations

### Optional Keys
